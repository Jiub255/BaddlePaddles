    -fix the problem with loading levels, especially the last one and the game over screen coming up too early


    GAME NOTES AND IDEAS
____________________________

    -Dual paddles with weird shaped bricks to break in the middle.

    -left and right side are death

    -eventually replace the paddles with animated characters
        -have separate animations for running up, down, and hitting the ball. maybe more
        -El & Arr. eeaaooaa
        -they could get levels and abilities and shit maybe
        -even have some dumb storyline?
        -maybe the ball(s) is/are some pet(s) who run(s) between them, killing enemies with whatever powers
        
    -could have "bosses" made out of bricks instead of just static levels. 
        -they could even be animated, by moving individual bricks
        
    -controls translate well to phone/tablet, each thumb controls a paddle

    -to switch from 1 to 2 player, just deactivate the "ball start right" and change the left balls sprite to red.

    -top and bottom edge design has a huge impact 
        -try geometric, patterned shapes as well as random weird ones.
        -make partially destructible borders.
        -eventually design borders to work with one another, 
         like a curve that launches into another curve on the other side.

    -maybe make the ball collider bigger and all others smaller to avoid weird angles? or something?

    -Keep track of how many bricks/points each paddle has scored. maybe the two chars get their own exp?

    -could eventually have different layouts than straight left to right. like have a corner or something

    -give lefty and righty control of their launch vector?

    -fine tune paddle colliders

    -adjust scoring system. make more varied bricks

    -powerups?


    GENERAL GAME OVERVIEW
_____________________________

    -left paddle and right paddle each start with a ball

    -if a ball touched your paddle last and it breaks a brick, you get a point

    -if you fail to bounce/block a ball and it goes past you, you lose a point

    -for two player mode, whoever has the highest score when all bricks are broken wins
        -can just activate/deactivate ball start right from the main menu for 1 or 2 player mode.

    -for one player mode, each paddle gets its score in "exp" or some currency used to improve that particular paddle
        -maybe have just one ball for one player, two is hard to keep track of. 
        -maybe have a second ball sometimes as a bonus thing though
